      <h3>Novel, by Arthur Rimbaud</h3>
      We aren't serious when we're seventeen. <br>
      —One fine evening, to hell with
      <ul>
        <li>beer
        <li>and lemonade,
      </ul>
      Noisy cafés with their shining lamps! We walk under the green linden trees of the park <br>

      The lindens smell good in the good June evenings! <br>
      At times the air is so scented that we close our eyes.<br>
      The wind laden with sounds—the town isn't far— <br>
      Has the smell of grapevines and beer . . .<br>

      —There you can see a very small patch <br>
      Of dark blue, framed by a little branch,<br>
      Pinned up by a naughty star, that melts <br>
      In gentle quivers, small and very white . . .<br>

      Night in June! Seventeen years old! <br>
      —We are overcome by it all <br>
      The sap is champagne and goes to our head . . . <br>
      We talked a lot and feel a kiss on our lips <br>
      Trembling there like a small insect . . .<br>

      Our wild heart moves through novels like Robinson Crusoe, <br>
      —When, in the light of a pale street lamp,<br>
      A girl goes by attractive and charming <br>
      Under the shadow of her father's terrible collar . . .<br>

    And as she finds you incredibly naïve, <br>
    While clicking her little boots,<br>
    She turns abruptly and in a lively way . . . <br>
    —Then cavatinas die on your lips . . .<br>

    You are in love. Occupied until the month of August. <br>
    You are in love. —Your sonnets make Her laugh.<br>
    All your friends go off, you are ridiculous. <br>
    —Then one evening the girl you worship deigned to write to you . . . !<br>

    —That evening, . . . —you return to the bright cafés, <br>
    You ask for
    <ul>
      <li>beer
      <li>or lemonade . . .
    </ul>
    —We're not serious when we are:
    <ol>
      <li> seventeen
      <li>And when we have green linden trees in the park.
    </ol>
