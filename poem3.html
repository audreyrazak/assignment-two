      <b>I</b><br>

      We aren't serious when we're seventeen. <br>
      —One fine evening, to hell with beer and lemonade,<br>
      Noisy cafés with their shining lamps! <br>
      We walk under the green linden trees of the park <br>

      The lindens smell good in the good June evenings! <br>
      At times the air is so scented that we close our eyes. <br>
      The wind laden with sounds—the town isn't far— <br>
      Has the smell of grapevines and beer . . . <br>

<br>
      <b>II</b><br>

      —There you can see a very small patch <br>
      Of dark blue, framed by a little branch, <br>
      Pinned up by a naughty star, that melts <br>
      In gentle quivers, small and very white . . . <br>

      Night in June! Seventeen years old! —We are overcome by it all <br>
      The sap is champagne and goes to our head . . . <br>
      We talked a lot and feel a kiss on our lips <br>
      Trembling there like a small insect . . . <br>

      <b>III</b><br>

      Our wild heart moves through novels like Robinson Crusoe, <br>
      —When, in the light of a pale street lamp, <br>
      A girl goes by attractive and charming <br>
      Under the shadow of her father's terrible collar . . .<br>

      And as she finds you incredibly naïve, <br>
      While clicking her little boots, <br>
      She turns abruptly and in a lively way . . . <br>
      —Then cavatinas die on your lips . . . <br>

<br>
      <b>IV</b><br>

      You are in love. Occupied until the month of August. <br>
      You are in love. —Your sonnets make Her laugh.<br>
      All your friends go off, you are ridiculous. <br>
      —Then one evening the girl you worship deigned to write to you . . . !<br>

      —That evening, . . . —you return to the bright cafés,<br>
      You ask for beer or lemonade . . . <br>
      —We're not serious when we are seventeen <br>
      And when we have green linden trees in the park.<br>
