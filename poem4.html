  <h4 class="header"><i>Novel</i>, by Arthur Rimbaud</h4>
  <div class="container1">
    <b>I</b><br>
    We aren't serious when we're seventeen.
    —One fine evening, to hell with beer and lemonade,<br>
    Noisy cafés with their shining lamps!
    We walk under the green linden trees of the park <br><br>

    The lindens smell good in the good June evenings!
    At times the air is so scented that we close our eyes.<br>
    The wind laden with sounds—the town isn't far—
    Has the smell of grapevines and beer . . . <br><br>
  </div>
  <div class="container2"> <b>I</b><br>
    —There you can see a very small patch
    Of dark blue, framed by a little branch, <br>
    Pinned up by a naughty star, that melts
    In gentle quivers, small and very white . . . <br><br>

    Night in June! Seventeen years old! —We are overcome by it all
    The sap is champagne and goes to our head . . . <br>
    We talked a lot and feel a kiss on our lips
    Trembling there like a small insect . . . <br><br>
  </div>
  <div class="container3"> <b>III</b> <br>
    Our wild heart moves through novels like Robinson Crusoe,
    —When, in the light of a pale street lamp,<br>
    A girl goes by attractive and charming
    Under the shadow of her father's terrible collar . . .<br> <br>

    And as she finds you incredibly naïve,
    While clicking her little boots,<br>
    She turns abruptly and in a lively way . . .
    —Then cavatinas die on your lips . . .<br> <br>
  </div>
  <div class="container4"> <b>IV</b><br>
    You are in love. Occupied until the month of August.
    You are in love. —Your sonnets make Her laugh. <br>
    All your friends go off, you are ridiculous.
    —Then one evening the girl you worship deigned to write to you . . . !<br><br>

    —That evening, . . . —you return to the bright cafés,
    You ask for beer or lemonade . . . <br>
    —We're not serious when we are seventeen
    And when we have green linden trees in the park. <br><br>
