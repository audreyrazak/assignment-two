      <h5>Novel by Arthur Rimbaud</h5>
<span>
We aren't serious when we're seventeen.
—One fine evening, to hell with <em>beer and lemonade,</em><br>
Noisy cafés with their shining lamps!
We walk under the green linden trees of the park <br> <br>
</span>
<span>
The lindens smell good in the good June evenings!
At times the air is so scented that we close our eyes. <br>
The wind laden with sounds—the town isn't far—
Has the smell of grapevines and <strong>beer . . .</strong><br> <br>
</span>
<span>
—There you can see a very small patch
Of dark blue, framed by a little branch, <br>
Pinned up by a naughty star, that melts
In gentle quivers, small and very white . . . <br> <br>
</span>
<span>
Night in June! Seventeen years old! —We are overcome by it all
The sap is champagne and goes to our head . . . <br>
We talked a lot and feel a kiss on our lips
Trembling there like a small insect . . . <br><br>
</span>
<span>
Our wild heart moves through novels like Robinson Crusoe,
—When, in the light of a pale street lamp, <br>
A girl goes by attractive and charming
Under the shadow of her father's terrible collar . . . <br><br>
</span>
<span>
And as she finds you incredibly naïve,
While clicking her little boots,<br>
She turns abruptly and in a lively way . . .
—Then cavatinas die on your lips . . . <br><br>
</span>
<span>
<em>You are in love.</em> Occupied until the month of August.
<em>You are in love.</em> —Your sonnets make Her laugh.<br>
All your friends go off, you are ridiculous.
—Then one evening the girl you worship deigned to write to you . . . !<br><br>
</span>
<span>
—That evening, . . . —you return to the bright cafés,
You ask for <em>beer or lemonade . . .</em><br>
—We're not serious when we are seventeen
And when we have green linden trees in the park.<br><br>
